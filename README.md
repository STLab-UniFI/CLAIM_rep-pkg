## CLAIM documentation
Brief overview on CLAIM.

### Exposed methods

The main method is:
- <code>claim(repository name, repository base directory)</code>, which returns the set of identified microservices by 
calling:
  - <code>choose_dc(repository base directory)</code>, that chooses the right compose file;
  - <code>dc_collect_services(compose file, repository base directory)</code>, that extracts the list of Docker
services;
  - <code>process_services(list of Docker services, repository base directory)</code>, that elaborates the 
selected compose in order to extract the images, builds and containers;
  - <code>determine_microservices(repository user, repository name, repository base directory, candidate microservices
</code>, that determines the microservices.

### Configuration parameters
Here the configuration parameters used by CLAIM:
- filenames for compose file to be selected:

  ```
  *docker-compose*.yml, *docker-compose*.yaml, *compose*.yml, *compose*.yaml
  ```
  
- folder considered "neutral" for compose file to be accepted:

  ```
  docker*, *compose, swarm,
  src, services,
  dev*, test*, staging, deploy*, integration, release, prod*,
  iac, saas, devops, setup*, script*, complete, etc
  ```

- folder weights for compose file sorting (lexicographically with respect to path): same order as above, decreasing weight
- affixes considered "neutral" for compose file to be accepted:

  ```
  services, base,
  dev*, build*, stack, prod*, stable, deploy*, test*  
  ```
  
- affixes considered undesired for compose file to be discarded:

  ```
  infra*, override  
  ```

- affixes weights for compose file to be chosen: same order as above, decreasing weight

- filenames for Dockerfile to be selected:

  ```
  *Dockerfile*
  ```

- extensions for resulting files to be discarded (i.e. false positives Dockerfile):

  ```
  .sh, .ps1, .nanowin, .txt
  ```

- folder for Dockerfile to be discarded:

  ```
  vendor, external, example, demo
  ```
  

- extensions considered "configuration" when copied into filesystem of containers

  ```
  .sh, .xml, .txt, .yaml, .yml, .sql,
  .conf, .config, .cnf, .cfg, .cf, .crt, .key
  ```
  

## Quick start
Brief documentation on how to use the replication material.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10

### Preliminary

- Clone the repo in the directory you want (we refer to it as `{CLONE_DIR}`):

  ```
  git clone * {CLONE_DIR}
  ```

- Install all the Python package required:

  ```
  pip install -r src/requirements.txt
  ```

### Experiment

- Set GitHub token in <code>config.py</code>

- Run the compose file detection with CLAIM:

  ```
  python src.A_dc_choice {"dataset_real"/"dataset_ground_truth"}
  ```

- Run the compose file detection with Baresi et al.:

  ```
  python src.A_dc_choice_Baresi {"dataset_real"/"dataset_ground_truth"}
  ```
  
- Run the microservices identification with CLAIM:

  ```
  python src.A_ms_detection {"dataset_real"/"dataset_ground_truth"}
  ```

- Run the microservices identification with Baresi et al.:

  ```
  python src.A_ms_detection_Baresi {"dataset_real"/"dataset_ground_truth"}
  ```
  
- Run the profilation:

  ```
  python scalene --memory --cpu --- -m src.B_profilation {repository} {"claim"/"baresi"}
  ```
